Quick Self Presentation
16, December 2025.
Hello my name is Tiago Charruadas im 26 years old and im from Portugal. Ive stumbled apon programming/code when i was at my 10th grade in highschool when i was 18, i was always curious about it but with some self doubt and working another jobs i completly put it aside. Today im taking the leap to be consistent and learn as much as i can and push foward when things get difficult or when i encounter rock in my way. I usually think that my times up when it comes to finding a way in coding and im too late for it but im still going to do it. I hope you find some authentacy and pureness in my projects because im human. One of my main objectives in this journey is helping others that want to pursue the same path and contributing to diferent projects.
